Ars.Natura.Uta had the pleasure of hosting visiting artist <a href="http://www.foonsham.com/" target="_blank">Foon Sham</a> last week. For seven full days, Foon was immersed in Bolivian culture.

During the week, Foon visited La Paz’s many museums, well-respected galleries like Merida Romero’s, met with local artists, and gave a presentation to art students at the University Mayor de San Andres in La Paz.

Inspired particularly by the mountains that surround us, Foon left us with a sculpture, currently in progress as seen by the pictures below, that will be inaugurated at Ars.Natura.Uta for IS Day 2016, a global event hosted by the International Sculpture Organization.
