title: Visiting Artist 2016 Foon Sham
---

Ars.Natura.Uta had the pleasure of hosting visiting artist Foon Sham last week. For seven full days, Foon was immersed in Bolivian culture.

During the week, Foon visited La Paz’s many museums, well-respected galleries like Merida Romero’s, met with local artists, and gave a presentation to art students at the University Mayor de San Andres in La Paz.

Inspired particularly by the mountains that surround us, Foon left us with a sculpture, currently in progress as seen by the pictures below, that will be inaugurated at Ars.Natura.Uta for IS Day 2016, a global event hosted by the International Sculpture Organization.
