In celebration of the International Sculpture Day, ARS.NATURA.UTA – The Project, invites the public to an open-house tour and celebration of its facilities in the rural community of Achocalla in the vicinity of La Paz, Bolivia.

The tour will highlight the main building, styled after the 18th century Jesuit Mission buildings located in Chiquitos, near Santa Cruz, Bolivia, as well as include the sculpture garden and ecological facilities. The tour will be guided by the director and owner of the center, with insight into the inspiration and creation process of Ars.Natura.Uta. There will be also be a small art exhibit inside the courtyard of the main building.

Full-time staff and the local volunteer youth of the community will be available to answer questions on the why and how of the sculptures, as well as provide information and access to the garden flowers, vegetables and farm animals.

There will also be a papermaking demonstration and, following that, a workshop open to all ages. All materials will be covered.
