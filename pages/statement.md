"As artists, we have the ability of combining our art skills with the need for awareness of the physical world. I believe our role is to initiate interaction not only with nature in general, but, more importantly, with the involvement of the creative viewers. We must focus on the need to preserve our environment - to engage through collaboration and make possible the changes that are necessary to reclaim and sustain our natural resources."
