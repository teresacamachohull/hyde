  <p class="message">
“As artists, we have the ability of combining our art skills with the need for awareness of the physical world. I believe our role is to initiate interaction not only with nature in general, but, more importantly, with the involvement of the creative viewers. We must focus on the need to preserve our environment - to engage through collaboration and make possible the changes that are necessary to reclaim and sustain our natural resources.”

<p><strong>Bio</strong></p>

<p>María Teresa Camacho-Hull received a MFA from the University of Maryland, College Park and an MA in Hispanic Literature from The Catholic University of America, Washington DC. She also received an Associate Degree in Photography, working solely with it for seven years.</p>

<p>She was born in Cochabamba, Bolivia, spent a year as a high school exchange students in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and  met her husband Charles Jesse Hull II in La Paz, while he was serving as a Marine Guard in the U.S. Embassy. She moved to the United States after her marriage to Chuck and for over forty years now has been living in Montgomery County, Maryland. Currently she splits her time between the USA and Bolivia, commuting back and forth and working all the while in her studios in both countries.</p>

<p>Together with her late husband Chuck she is the owner and founder of ARS.NATURA.UTA, a Culture and Arts Center in the rural community of Achocalla, just outside of La Paz, Bolivia.</p>

<p>For María Teresa, Bolivia and her adopted USA are two countries that will always be in her heart. This duality that has encompassed her life inspires her art.</p>
