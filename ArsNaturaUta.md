Ars.Natura.Uta is an Arts and Culture Center located in the heart of the rural community of Achocalla, a city on the outskirts of La Paz, Bolivia.

The center began in 2004 with the construction of the main building in the style of the 18th cent. Jesuit Missions of Chiquitos, made with locally-sourced materials and built by community workers in collaboration with master carpenters from the Chiquitos-area in southern Bolivia. Since then, as the center has grown, it has kept that fundamental aspect of combining traditional Bolivian knowledge and craft with nature and the arts. 

Ars.Natura.Uta is a privately-owned center and studio where environmental questions, as well as community and cultural concerns, are channeled through various forms of art, in a hope to clarify and strengthen the issues.
